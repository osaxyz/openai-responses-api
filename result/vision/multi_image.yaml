          text: "- **Subject:** The first image shows a **black puppy/dog**; the second shows a **small dog (looks like a pug)** wrapped up.

            - **Setting:** First is indoors/on a **wood plank floor**; second is outdoors in a **forest/greenery** on a leafy ground.

            - **Pose/Composition:** First is a close-up with the dog lying/crouched and looking up at the camera; second is a wider shot with the dog **sitting** and mostly covered by a **blanket**.

            - **Color/Lighting:** First is darker and more neutral (black dog + brown wood); second has more natural greens and a softer, outdoor look.

            - **Props:** No props in the first image; a **striped blanket** is prominent in the second."
